# mineimator-install
A quick way to install a universally-launchable "Mine-imator" instance on Debian GNU/Linux

## What does this script do?
This script allows the user to easily install the latest version of [Mine-imator 2.0.2](https://www.mineimatorforums.com/index.php?/topic/90789-mine-imator-202/) made for Debian & Ubuntu.

### NOTE: What distros does it work on?
[Debian "bookworm"](https://www.mineimatorforums.com/index.php?/topic/90789-mine-imator-202/) (also known as "*Debian 12 Stable*") is the only OS this was tested on. Your mileage may vary.

The build itself is designed for Ubuntu & Debian. If there is anyone who wants to contribute an alternative script path for Ubuntu, or make another install for another Linux-based OS, feel free to make a pull request.
